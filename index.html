                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>Bethel Evangelical Church of Michigan (BECM) stands as a beacon of spiritual fellowship and community for Ethiopians and Eritreans residing in the vibrant state of Michigan. Established with a vision to nurture a faith community that reflects the cultural and spiritual values of its members, BECM has grown from humble beginnings into a thriving evangelical church.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Beginnings</h3>
                    <p>The roots of BECM trace back to a small home fellowship and a dedicated Bible study group where individuals sought to deepen their understanding of the Word of God and share their faith journeys. In 2007, recognizing the need for a formal space for worship and communal gatherings, BECM took a significant step forward by initiating formal services.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Home at Emmanuel Lutheran Church</h3>
                    <p>This transformative phase unfolded within the warm embrace of the Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Ypsilanti. Partnering with Emmanuel Lutheran Church provided BECM with a supportive environment and a physical space to conduct Sunday School sessions, worship services, and communal prayers. The premises of Emmanuel Lutheran Church have become the nurturing ground for the spiritual growth and communal bond that characterize BECM today.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Present Ministry</h3>
                    <p>At present, BECM continues to thrive within the welcoming walls of Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Ypsilanti. This location serves as the heart of our community, providing a sacred space where individuals can come together for spiritual enrichment, cultural celebration, and mutual support. Every Sunday, the church echoes with the sounds of worship, resonating with prayers and teachings that bridge the cultural and spiritual heritage of Ethiopians and Eritreans in Michigan.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
                    <p>BECM's commitment goes beyond the confines of formal services. It extends into the realm of education and communal development through Sunday School sessions that empower individuals with a deeper understanding of their faith. The church's activities and gatherings aim not only to foster spiritual growth but also to create a sense of belonging and unity among its diverse congregation.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                    <p>In summary, Bethel Evangelical Church of Michigan (BECM) is not just a place of worship; it is a living testament to the resilience, unity, and faith of Ethiopians and Eritreans in Michigan. From its inception in a small home fellowship to its present-day establishment within Emmanuel Lutheran Church, BECM stands as a vibrant community, continually evolving to meet the spiritual and cultural needs of its members.</p>

                <p>Our journey to fulfillment through embracing faith as immigrant Americans</p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-content">
                <div class="background-text">
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>The pursuit of fulfillment and the search for the meaning of life are universal endeavors that resonate across cultures and borders. Every human being, regardless of their background, grapples with questions that transcend the material and delve into the spiritual. In this exploration, a profound message from the Bible challenges individuals to reflect on the essence of their journey and the broader human experience.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>The overarching objective of our church is to explore the shared aspirations of humanity, shaping a big question that delves into the universal meaning of life. Through the lens of the biblical message, we aim to address this fundamental question, offering insights that may guide individuals from all walks of life on a path toward fulfillment and purpose.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Warning from the Gospel</h3>
                    <p>Embedded in the Gospel, a poignant question resounds three times: "What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Matthew 16:24; Mark 8:36; Luke 9:25). This biblical inquiry transcends cultural and religious boundaries, urging individuals to confront a fundamental question that lies at the core of their being – the quest for the meaning of life.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Consequence of Inaction</h3>
                    <p>Inaction in this matter is a failure to engage with life's decisions, leads to a twofold form of death. The first, a physical death, is a journey to the grave, while the second, a spiritual death, manifests as an eternity in hell. The biblical assertion that "the wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23) serves as a crucial point of contemplation, pushing individuals to reassess their priorities.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Solution: Jesus Christ is the Redeemer</h3>
                    <p>In response to the profound question of losing one's soul, in our teachings we assert that Jesus Christ is the ultimate solution. It contends that acknowledging Him as the Savior, obeying His teachings, and entrusting one's life to Him constitute the pathway to redemption. The reassurance from the Bible that those who come to Jesus will not be cast away (John 6:37) becomes a beacon of hope in the search for meaning and fulfillment.</p>
                    
                    <h3>A Call to Action</h3>
                    <p>In this narrative we extend an earnest appeal to every individual, irrespective of their background, to consider embracing Jesus as the answer to life's ultimate questions. We encourage a personal exploration of the love and saving grace of Jesus, emphasizing not an invitation to join a religious organization but an opportunity to experience eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Urgency of the Message</h3>
                    <p>Highlighting that the call to embrace Jesus has persisted since His earthly ministry, the essay underscores the inevitability of death and subsequent judgment. In this message we underscore God's love, patience, and willingness to forgive sins upon repentance, providing assurance of eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Bethel's Commitment</h3>
                    <p>We affirm Bethel's commitment to addressing the big question through teaching and preaching the Word of God. As a community, Bethel aims to create an environment where individuals from all corners of the globe can explore the transformative power of faith. Through teaching, preaching, prayer, and care for all who share this value and beyond, Bethel seeks to be a guiding light on the journey toward fulfillment and purpose.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Understanding Sin and Redemption</h3>
                    <p>We display deep awareness about the concept of sin and its consequences. Yet, we have the divine bridge provided by Jesus Christ. Knowing God personally and experiencing His love is possible through repentance and faith in Christ, who declared, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6).</p>
                    
                    <h3>Steps Towards Spiritual Growth</h3>
                    <p>Come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ through repentance is not a complicated process, it is simply a practical step for those who choose to believe in God and place their faith in Jesus Christ and finding a Bible-believing community, studying the Scriptures, practicing prayers, and participation in sacraments such as baptism and the Lord's Supper.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>In confronting the profound questions of life, we invite all from every corner of the world on a journey of spiritual life with the shared objective shaped through the biblical message. We call to explore the transformative power of faith in Jesus Christ, offering insights that guide individuals, regardless of their cultural or religious background, on a path toward fulfillment and purpose. The call to embrace Jesus is not confined to any specific group; rather, it is a universal and transformative invitation to discover the true essence of existence and embark on a journey toward everlasting fulfillment. Bethel, in its commitment, stands ready to pray for individuals on this transformative quest and life journey.</p>

This commission, as outlined in Matthew 28:19-20, calls for the making of disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to observe all that Christ has commanded. Bethel-ECM envisions itself as a catalyst for this transformative process, working towards the holistic development of individuals and the establishment of a vibrant community of believers.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Ministry for Sanctified Living</h3>
                    <p>Bethel-ECM is dedicated to cultivating a ministry that goes beyond the ordinary, focusing on sanctified living. The term "sanctified" denotes a state of being set apart and consecrated for a sacred purpose. In this context, it signifies a commitment to a life that reflects the teachings of Christ and aligns with the principles of righteousness. The ministry at Bethel-ECM seeks to guide individuals towards spiritual maturity, enabling them to lead sanctified lives in alignment with biblical truths.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Transformation through Sound Doctrine</h3>

By providing a solid theological foundation, the community aims to equip believers with the knowledge and understanding necessary for transformation. Sound doctrine forms the bedrock upon which the sanctification process unfolds, ensuring that every aspect of life is guided by biblical principles.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Exemplary Servant Leadership</h3>
                    <p>Bethel-ECM envisions a community where servant leadership is not just a concept but a lived reality. Leaders within the community are called to exemplify the humility and sacrificial service demonstrated by Jesus Christ. This model of leadership aims to inspire and guide others towards a similar ethos, fostering an environment where selfless service becomes a way of life.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Community of Transformed Believers</h3>
                    <p>The ultimate goal of Bethel-ECM's vision is to establish a community of transformed and perfected believers. This community is characterized by individuals who, through the ministry's teachings, have experienced a profound inner change. The sanctified living and exemplary servant leadership witnessed within the community become a testament to the transformative power of Christ's teachings.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>At Bethel-ECM, we proudly identify ourselves as true students of the Word of God, driven by an unwavering commitment to teach and live by its eternal truths. Anchored in the entirety of the 66 canonical books of the Scripture, we consider the Bible as the final authority, shaping both our individual lives and the overarching ministry. Our dedication to the Word manifests through comprehensive Bible study schedules in small local groups, as well as our focused Sunday preaching and teaching sessions, all centered around the true Word of God.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Teaching the Truth</h3>
                    <p>As stewards of the Word, our foremost objective is to teach the unadulterated truth of the Scriptures. We draw inspiration from the entire canon, understanding that every book contributes to the cohesive narrative that guides our faith and practice. The Bible, in its entirety, becomes the compass by which we navigate life, ministry, and discipleship.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Small Group Bible Studies</h3>
                    <p>Bethel-ECM places a strong emphasis on fostering intimate connections within the community through small group Bible studies. In these settings, individuals engage in profound discussions, exploring the depths of Scripture and its application to daily life. These gatherings create spaces for shared learning, mutual encouragement, and spiritual growth, embodying the principle that "iron sharpens iron" (Proverbs 27:17).</p>
                    
                    <h3>Sunday Preaching and Teaching</h3>
                    <p>Our Sunday gatherings serve as a focal point where the entire community converges to worship, learn, and grow together. In these moments, our teaching is solely centered on the true Word of God. Through expository preaching and comprehensive teaching sessions, we aim to unveil the richness of biblical truths and their relevance to contemporary living.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Biblical Mandate for Teaching</h3>
                    <p>Bethel-ECM draws inspiration from the scriptural mandates that underscore the importance of teaching God's Word. Scriptures such as Joshua 1:7-8, Ezekiel 3:1-3, Acts 6:4, Matthew 13:18-23, and Colossians 3:16 serve as guiding principles, emphasizing the transformative power of the Word when diligently studied and shared. In the footsteps of the disciples who filled Jerusalem with their teaching, we aspire to extend our reach, filling the whole earth with the declaration that "Jesus is Lord."</p>
                    
                    <h3>Global Vision</h3>
                    <p>As disciples of Christ, our vision transcends local boundaries. Drawing inspiration from the biblical narrative and the Great Commission, we aspire to impact the world with the teachings of the Word. Our commitment is rooted in the belief that the transformative message of Christ should reach every corner of the earth, declaring the lordship of Jesus.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>At Bethel-ECM, the dedication to God's Word is not merely a doctrinal stance but a living reality. Through meticulous study, fervent teaching, and intentional community engagement, we strive to nurture disciples who are deeply rooted in the truths of Scripture. Our vision extends beyond the local community, aiming to fill the whole earth with the life-changing teachings of the Word that unequivocally declare, "Jesus is Lord!"</p>
